# Configuration for Alacritty, the GPU enhanced terminal emulator

# Any items in the `env` entry below will be added as
# environment variables. Some entries may override variables
# set by alacritty itself.
env:
  # TERM variable
  #
  # This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for
  # each instance of Alacritty. If it is not present, alacritty will
  # check the local terminfo database and use `alacritty` if it is
  # available, otherwise `xterm-256color` is used.
  TERM: xterm-256color
    #
  # Startup Mode (changes require restart)
  startup_mode: Fullscreen

window:
  # Blank space added around the window in pixels. This padding is scaled
  # by DPI and the specified value is always added at both opposing sides.
  padding:
    x: 5
    y: 0

# Font configuration (changes require restart)
font:
  # The normal (roman) font face to use.
  normal:
    family: 'Fira Code'
    # Style can be specified to pick a specific face.
    style: Regular

  # The bold font face
  bold:
    family: 'Fira Code'
    # Style can be specified to pick a specific face.
    style: Bold

  # The italic font face
  italic:
    family: 'Fira Code'
    # Style can be specified to pick a specific face.
    style: Italic

  # Point size
  size: 14.0

  # Offset is the extra space around each character. `offset.y` can be thought of
  # as modifying the line spacing, and `offset.x` as modifying the letter spacing.
  offset:
    x: 1
    y: 3

  # Glyph offset determines the locations of the glyphs within their cells with
  # the default being at the bottom. Increasing `x` moves the glyph to the right,
  # increasing `y` moves the glyph upward.
  #glyph_offset:
  #  x: 0
  #  y: 0

  # Thin stroke font rendering (macOS only)
  #
  # Thin strokes are suitable for retina displays, but for non-retina screens
  # it is recommended to set `use_thin_strokes` to `false`.
  #use_thin_strokes: true

# If `true`, bold text is drawn using the bright color variants.
draw_bold_text_with_bright_colors: true
